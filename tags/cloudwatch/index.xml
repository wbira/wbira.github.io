      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, to create a successful project we need a bit more than developed application. We should have CI/CD solution to deliver changes to upper environments. To prove that system still works, we can run set of e2e tests, but there&amp;rsquo;s one more thing, that we should set up in our system.
And this missing thing is monitoring, which will help us to keep control over health and performance of an application. It may help keep optimal percentage of resources utilization in a cloud, that will lead to reduced costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
